    <h1>Lessons Learned from My First Freelance Project</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">What I wish I knew before starting as a freelance designer and developer</p>

    <div class="post-content">
      <h2>📌 1. Clear Communication is Everything</h2>
      <p>I learned quickly that **unclear instructions lead to confusion**. My first client gave vague feedback like “make it pop” or “it feels off.” I had to learn to ask better questions like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the goal of this feature?</li>
        <li>Do you have a reference site or example in mind?</li>
        <li>Can you describe what “off” means to you?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🧾 2. Never Start Without a Contract</h2>
      <p>I started without a formal agreement—bad move. Midway through, the client changed their mind about the scope. Now, I always use a basic contract outlining:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Project scope & deliverables</li>
        <li>Deadlines</li>
        <li>Payment terms</li>
        <li>Revision limits</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>⏱ 3. Time Tracking Saves You</h2>
      <p>I underestimated how long things took. By tracking my time using apps like <strong>Toggle</strong> or <strong>Clockify</strong>, I could improve my pricing and avoid undercharging.</p>

      <h2>💸 4. Ask for a Deposit</h2>
      <p>On my first project, I waited until the end to get paid—and waited weeks. Now I request **50% upfront** and the rest on completion. It protects both sides.</p>

      <h2>📂 5. Keep Everything Organized</h2>
      <p>I used to lose client files or forget where I saved design drafts. I switched to organized folders like:</p>
      <pre><code>/ClientName/
  /Designs/
  /Development/
  /Invoices/
</code></pre>

      <h2>🎯 6. Focus on Solving Problems, Not Just Making Things Pretty</h2>
      <p>As a beginner, I focused on beautiful design. But clients care more about results. I started asking, “How will this help your users?” or “What’s the goal of this section?”</p>

      <h2>🔚 Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Freelancing is exciting but challenging. I made a lot of beginner mistakes, but each one taught me something valuable. If you’re starting out, take the time to learn from others—and from yourself.</p>
